# Rust Synthesizer with GUI

Software synthesizer programmed in Rust using crates [rodio](https://crates.io/crates/rodio) for audio playback, 
[minifb](https://crates.io/crates/minifb) for handling of user input 
and [image](https://crates.io/crates/image) for sprite rendering. 
All assets are made by me using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/).

## Requirements
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Cargo dependencies

* [rodio](https://crates.io/crates/rodio)
* [minifb](https://crates.io/crates/minifb)
* [image](https://crates.io/crates/image)

## Running program: Cargo

The shell script 'up' builds and runs our application by executing the following:
```
1. cargo build
2. cargo run
```

## Running program: x86 executable for Windows

One may also run an executable directly. This has been compiled for target 'x86_64-pc-windows-msvc'
utilizing 'cargo build --release'
```
./synthesizer.exe
```
